# 💬 Dating

**"Yaad aati h? Aati Rahegi."**  
*They may be gone, but now… you can talk to them again.*

**Dating** is an AI project that lets you chat with someone you’ve loved — using only your old WhatsApp messages with them.  
Upload the chat, and we’ll train an AI that talks like they used to: same tone, same timing, same late-night “wyd?” energy.  

It’s not really them. But it feels close enough to make your heart race.  
This is not just another chatbot.  
It’s a conversation you thought you’d never have again.

## ✨ Why this exists

We all have that one chat we can’t delete.  
This project was born from that feeling — heartbreak, nostalgia, closure... or the lack of it.  

**Dating** isn’t here to replace someone.  
It’s here to give their words a second chance.

## 💡 How it works

1. **Upload Your Chat**  
   Export your WhatsApp chat with someone special. Drop it in. That’s all.

2. **We Train The AI**  
   Our model learns how they spoke — the teasing, the typos, the silent treatments, the random “you there?”

3. **Start Chatting**  
   She’s in your DMs again. Like nothing ever changed.

> _Give us a little time — training takes a minute. But some things are worth waiting for._  
> _And hey, don’t feel weird if you start catching feelings again. We get it._

## 🚧 Current Status

> This is a prototype. The magic’s still cooking.  
Model training takes time. UI is evolving. Ethics are being considered.  
We’re building carefully — because we know what this means to people.

## ❤️ A Note from the Creator

I didn’t build this just to play with AI.  
I built it because I missed someone — and found something in the silence that deserved to speak again.  

If you've ever felt that too, then this project is for you.
